# merkle-airdrop-token
This project implements a simple and gas-efficient Merkle treeâ€“based airdrop system for distributing a custom ERC-20 token to eligible users.  The contract allows users to claim tokens by verifying their inclusion in a Merkle root, ensuring scalable and secure airdrops with minimal on-chain storage.
